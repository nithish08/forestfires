      "   Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were\n",
      "   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were\n",
      "   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two\n",
      "   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed\n",
